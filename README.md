# NBA Analysis

## Objective
The purpose of this notebook is to take an in-depth look at NBA statistics that range over decades. There's a lot of discussion concerning the evolution of the NBA from when the Centers were the dominant forces, and now the small and quick Point Guards are dominating the league. This along with questions like "Does college impact your NBA performance?" will be asked and analyzed in this project. Thank you for taking a look!
