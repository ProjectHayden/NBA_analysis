# Airbnb's of New York City Analysis

## Purpose
The purpose of this notebook is to further understand pricing of Airbnb's as they relate to one of the world's largest cities, New York City. I am an avid traveler, along with hundreds of millions of others in the world, and one of the biggest hassles can be finding a hotel. For *most of us*, it's a matter of price and this matter usually leads to us either renting or not. Airbnb has come along and disrupted the hotel industry, creating another marketplace for people looking to stay *and* people looking to host. 

I'm hoping to use this research to confirm my outlined predictions and then test those predictions.

This project consists of:
  * 1 Jupyter Notebook
  * This README
  
I'd like to thank the Inside Airbnb dataset that I used, past professors, friends for all the inspiration they've given me since beginning coding. And lastly, I'd like to thank you for reading through this.
